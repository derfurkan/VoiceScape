# VoiceScape
VoiceScape is a plugin that allows you to voice chat with other players who are also using the plugin in-game. This voice chat is distance-based, so if you're not close to other players who have the plugin, the server won't send you their voice data. Latency is 500ms to 1 Second high.

# What is it NOT
VoiceScape is not a alternative to discord or other VoIP applications.
Its a fun plugin where you run random into players and can talk with them if you are woodcutting or banking etc.
If you want to fight a Boss with your clan/friends use other VoIP's like Discord or Teamspeak instead.

# Will this leak my IP address?
### VoiceScape will not leak your IP address in any way and its not designed to do so.
The only one who can see your IP address is the one who owns the Server that you might will connect to.

# How can i hide my IP address?
You can tunnel your connection through a [Proxy](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/proxy-server) or [VPN](https://nordvpn.com/de/what-is-a-vpn/) service.<br/><br/>
If you cannot afford one of these services you can also rely on your provider assigning you a new IP Address by restarting your Router since most providers offer a dynamic IP Address.

### Context Matters (Really)
If you're an average user without a notable online presence, the risk of your IP being leaked or attacked remains relatively low. In most cases, the vast majority of players aren't subject to such targeted actions. 
### **Additionally, it's worth noting that VoiceScape makes the process of assigning your in-game identity to your IP harder using [hashing](https://fedemcmac.medium.com/hashing-and-encryption-for-dummies-in-case-you-were-wondering-83422b6e7554).**

# How can i host a server?
To easily host a server you can use cloud providers like [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/) which offers a free Redis server.<br/><br/>
Otherwise you can host your own Redis server on your local machine using this tutorial for Windows:
